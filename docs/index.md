# Advanced npm-on-ipfs features

## Updating your registry index

By default we keep a local copy of the npm registry index in your [`mfs`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-mfs) at `/npm-registry` and update it when you install new packages. This means for the first request for a given module it will be fetched from npm over http.  There is a continously updated copy of the npm registry index with CIDs for all modules being generated by the [`ipfs-npm-registry-mirror`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-npm-registry-mirror) - if you'd like to clone this registry index, use the `update-registry-index` subcommand:

```console
$ ipfs-npm update-registry-index
```
