**TLDR: npm-on-ipfs enables you to install your favourite modules from the distributed web using IPFS, as well as to have a cache always ready and shared on your local network ‚Äî great for enterprise and community coding settings, or even just enabling more speedy work when you and your friends are working at a low-bandwidth coffee shop.**

## Quick background

As the largest software registry in the world, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is also the de facto package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem, with more than [900k](https://replicate.npmjs.com/_all_docs) packages and more than 7 billion downloads a week. It's incredibly fast and reliable ‚Äî however, we couldn't stop ourselves from wondering what would happen if we put the world's largest registry on the distributed web.

The result is npm-on-ipfs: a module that wraps your package manager of choice (npm or yarn) in configuration to use [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), not HTTP, to retrieve your dependencies from the central npm registry. It's still a work in progress, but we think you'll find it useful and awesome for the following reasons:

 - Having dependencies on the distributed web makes development **more available** because multiple nodes supplying tarballs means no panic if a single source goes dark
 - It can also be **faster and cheaper** ‚Äî if dependencies are already being hosted on your local network, this means lower bandwidth cost and higher speed
 - If enough dependencies are hosted on your local network (think enterprise or community development settings), that network can operate **offline-first**: Take your team on a remote mountain retreat and hack away!

## Install & use

```console
$ npm i ipfs-npm -g
```

### Get started!

`ipfs-npm` wraps your favorite package manager (npm or yarn) with configuration that uses IPFS, rather than HTTP, to retrieve your dependencies from the central npm registry. Since it's intended to replace npm/yarn, all the commands you're used to will work in the same way.

For example: In the directory with your `package.json` file, run ...

```console
$ ipfs-npm install
üëø Spawning an in-process IPFS node
Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/57029/ipfs/QmVDtTRCoYyYu5JFdtrtBMS4ekPn8f9NndymoHdWuuJ7N2
üóÇÔ∏è Loading registry index from https://registry.js.ipfs.io
‚òéÔ∏è Dialling registry mirror /ip4/35.178.192.119/tcp/10015/ipfs/QmWBaYSnmgZi6F6D69JuZGhyL8rm6pt8GX5r7Atc6Gd7vR,/dns4/registry.js.ipfs.io/tcp/10015/ipfs/QmWBaYSnmgZi6F6D69JuZGhyL8rm6pt8GX5r7Atc6Gd7vR
üóëÔ∏è Replacing old registry index if it exists
üì† Copying registry index /ipfs/QmQmVsNFw3stJky7agrETeB9kZqkcvLSLRnFFMrhiR8zG1 to /npm-registry
üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Starting local proxy
üöÄ Server running on port 57314
üéÅ Installing dependencies with /Users/alex/.nvm/versions/node/v10.8.0/bin/npm
...
```

You can use any command you'd use with npm/yarn with ipfs-npm in exactly the same way:

```console
$ ipfs-npm install
$ ipfs-npm version minor
$ ipfs-npm publish
$ ipfs-npm --package-manager=yarn
// etc
```

$ ipfs-npm --help

## Configuration files

ipfs-npm uses [`rc`](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) to parse configuration files. Please see the [`rc` repository](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards) for the order of precedence used when searching for configuration files. The app is `ipfs-npm`.

For instance, if you want to always use a remote daemon, you could create a `~/.ipfs-npmrc` file like this:

```json
{
  "ipfsNode": "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001"
}
```
